# Vigraph

## Intro 
A web based graphing calculator made in javascript (sadly not very responsive on small devices). Vigraph visualises equations with y as the subject and can animate the results. The calculator is still quite simple but I may add some more features later. To use, type an equation in the upper left text box. You can use the s variable in your formula to add animated features, it will by defualt oscilate between 0 and 10 but you can move the slider to change the limit.  

## Installation
Vigraph should run on most web browsers as it is vanilla js so to install just clone this repository and open it in one to play around with it, alternitevely you can view it on repl [here](https://replit.com/@HamishHamiltonS/Visgraph-Graphing-calculator?v=1).

## Examples

Here are some examples on what vigraph can make:
